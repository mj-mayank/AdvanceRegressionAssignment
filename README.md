# Housing Price Prediction
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:
  - Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house
  - How well those variables describe the price of a house.

# Model Building Steps:
The assignemnt is divided into below sections:
  - Reading and Understanding data
  - Visualising the data and performing EDA
  - Data preparation(adding dummy variables, diving into train and test data)
  - Data modelling using Ridge and Lasso methods
  - Finding optimum alpha
  - Residual Analysis
  - Making predictions using final model(model 11 in this case)
  - Final Outcome
