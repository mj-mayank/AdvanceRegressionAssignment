# Housing Price Prediction
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:
  - Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
  - How well those variables describe the price of a house.
So that they can understand the pricing dynamics of new area.
